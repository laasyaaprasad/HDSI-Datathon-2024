Harvard Data Science Initiative - Datathon 2024

The project aims to explore the relationship between farmer age demographics and agricultural production across various regions in the contiguous United States. This investigation will delve into how trends in the average age of farmers, a statistic that has been rising steadily, may impact food production and economic sustainability. By analyzing demographic and land data, the project seeks to understand age-related patterns within states. The analysis involved examining crop sales data and adjusting for inflation to provide a clear picture of economic trends tied to farmer age, potentially highlighting regions where the aging farmer population poses risks to production.

Questions guiding the project include examining variations in farmer age over time and assessing the economic impact of aging within agriculture. By creating visualizations the project aims to display regional differences and spatiotemporal trends and analyze relationships between
avarage farmer age and farm production, before and after inflation, thereby supporting a comprehensive understanding of how farmer demographics could shape the future of U.S. agriculture.
